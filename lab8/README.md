# Lab8

## Introduction

In this lab, you will write a angr script in `solve.py` to crack secret key in `chal.c` and get flag.

## Preparation (Important!!!)

1. Sync fork your branch (e.g., `SQLab:311XXXXXX`)
2. `git checkout -b lab8` (**NOT** your student ID !!!)

## Requirement

(100%) Write a angr script and satisfy following requirements.
1. Explore flag is in stdout or not by angr to solve secret key.
2. Write secret key to stdout, and `validate.sh` pass it to `./chal` to check secret key.
You can run `validate.sh` in your local to test if you satisfy the requirements.

Please note that you must not alter files other than `solve.py`. You will get 0 points if

1. you modify other files to achieve requirements.
2. you can't pass all CI on your PR.

## Submission

You need to open a pull request to your branch (e.g. 311XXXXXX, your student number) and contain the code that satisfies the abovementioned requirements.

Moreover, please submit the URL of your PR to E3. Your submission will only be accepted when you present at both places.
